Most people don’t need “more information” about cannabis—they need clearer, more practical guidance. Between myths, half-remembered advice from friends, and fast-changing regulations, it’s easy to feel unsure.

## FAQ

<ImagePlaceholder />

Duration depends on format and dose. Inhalation often peaks sooner; edibles last longer and can feel stronger once they kick in ([National Institute on Drug Abuse (cannabis)](https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/marijuana)).

Practical tip: write down the product name, THC/CBD amounts, and timing so you can adjust next time. [PubMed Central (free full text)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

### What’s the difference between THC and CBD?

THC is the primary intoxicating cannabinoid; CBD is non-intoxicating and may change the subjective feel for some people ([CDC (cannabis and health)](https://www.cdc.gov/cannabis/index.html)).

Practical tip: write down the product name, THC/CBD amounts, and timing so you can adjust next time. [PubMed Central (free full text)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

### Can I build tolerance quickly?

Frequent use can change how strongly you feel effects. If you’re using often, consider structured breaks and lower doses ([NIH (PubMed)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)).

Practical tip: write down the product name, THC/CBD amounts, and timing so you can adjust next time. [PubMed Central (free full text)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

### Are edibles “stronger” than smoking?

They can feel that way because oral THC is metabolized differently and effects can be delayed, leading to overconsumption ([National Institute on Drug Abuse (cannabis)](https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/marijuana)).

Practical tip: write down the product name, THC/CBD amounts, and timing so you can adjust next time. [PubMed Central (free full text)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

### What should beginners buy first?

Many beginners do best with low-dose, clearly-labeled products and a plan to go slow. A good dispensary team can help match goals to formats ([Mayo Clinic (edibles overview)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/)).

Practical tip: write down the product name, THC/CBD amounts, and timing so you can adjust next time. [PubMed Central (free full text)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

### Can cannabis cause anxiety?

Higher THC doses can increase anxiety in some people. Lower doses and balanced THC:CBD options may feel steadier for some users ([CDC (cannabis and health)](https://www.cdc.gov/cannabis/index.html)).

Practical tip: write down the product name, THC/CBD amounts, and timing so you can adjust next time. [PubMed Central (free full text)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

### Is cannabis safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?

Health authorities generally advise against cannabis during pregnancy/breastfeeding. If you need guidance, talk with a clinician ([Cleveland Clinic (marijuana)](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/21562-marijuana-cannabis)).

Practical tip: write down the product name, THC/CBD amounts, and timing so you can adjust next time. [PubMed Central (free full text)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

### What if I take too much?

Time, calm surroundings, hydration, and reassurance help. If severe symptoms occur, seek medical care ([Cleveland Clinic (marijuana)](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/21562-marijuana-cannabis)).

Practical tip: write down the product name, THC/CBD amounts, and timing so you can adjust next time. [PubMed Central (free full text)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).
